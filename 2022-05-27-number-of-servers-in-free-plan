## Description of the change

We change from 3 to 1 servers for the free plan.

Moralis has a very generous free plan where each free user can currently create 3 machines. 

Because we don't require any telephone verification or credit card information this sometimes leads to abuse where it's possible to spam free accounts and create free machines that we have to run.

By being able to create a server on the free plan anyone is still free to build and experiment with Moralis and if the project is serious it's very cheap to get our paid plan.

## What exactly can break?

If you have more than 1 server you will need to upgrade to a paid plan to wake them up from sleep.

## How to ensure my app won't break?

Upgrade to a paid plan or ensure that you only have 1 free server in your account.
