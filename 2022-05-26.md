## Description of the change

### New fields introduced
We currently return the field `synced_at` that represent when the metadata was updated or failed to be updated
We introduced two new fields `last_token_uri_sync` and `last_metadata_sync`
`last_metadata_sync` represent when the metadata for an NFT was updated
`last_token_uri_sync` represent when the token_uri for an NFT was updated or failed to be updated

## What exactly can break?

In one week from now, we will stop returning `synced_at` on our API.

## How to ensure my app won't break?

Applications that depends on this field should start reading `last_token_uri_sync` and/or `last_metadata_sync`.
`last_metadata_sync` is the closed to `synced_at` since both are updated when the metadata is saved

## When will this change go live ?
